# Analyzing-blinkit-data

I designed and developed this interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize grocery sales data for BlinkIT, showcasing my ability to extract meaningful insights from raw data. Starting with a structured dataset containing item-level and outlet-level attributes, I performed data cleaning, transformation, and modeling within Power BI to prepare the data for analysis.

## Tech Stack

**Application:** Power BI

Microsoft Excel

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

**Techniques:** Data Visualization & Data Modeling techniques




## Optimizations

Used DAX measures to reduce visual load time

Data cleaning performed within Power BI using Power Query

Categorized fields and standardized naming conventions


## Features

- Light/dark mode toggle
- Live previews
- Fullscreen mode
- Cross platform
- Clean and Structured Data Model
- Time-Based Analysis
- Reusable Measures and Fields


## Roadmap

Here‚Äôs the structured workflow I followed to complete this Power BI project:

üì• **1. Data Acquisition:**
Collected the dataset from BlinkIT containing product-level and outlet-level details.

Loaded raw data into Power BI using Excel files.

üßπ **2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
Removed duplicates, corrected data types, and handled missing values using Power Query Editor.

Renamed columns for better readability and consistency.

üîÅ **3. Data Transformation:**
Created new calculated columns and measures using DAX for meaningful insights.

Built relationships between tables (data modeling) to enable dynamic filtering and slicing.

üìä **4. Data Visualization:**
Designed multiple visuals (bar charts, pie charts, slicers, etc.) to reflect:

Item-wise sales trends

Outlet performance comparisons

Customer feedback analysis

Sales by visibility and year

Used slicers for interactive filtering by item type, outlet location, etc.

üéØ **5. Insights Extraction:**
Identified top-performing items and underperforming outlets.

Analyzed outlet type and location impact on overall sales.

Extracted actionable insights from customer ratings.

üìå **6. Dashboard Finalization:**
Optimized visuals for clarity and aesthetics.

Used consistent themes and color schemes for professional presentation.

üì§ **7. Deployment & Sharing:**
Saved the .pbix file.

Published to Power BI Service for sharing with stakeholders.

## Usage

**This dashboard helps:**

Retail businesses plan inventory based on popularity

BlinkIT optimize outlet strategies

Marketing teams target region-specific promotions
