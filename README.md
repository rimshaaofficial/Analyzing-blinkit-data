# Analyzing-blinkit-data

I designed and developed this interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize grocery sales data for BlinkIT, showcasing my ability to extract meaningful insights from raw data. Starting with a structured dataset containing item-level and outlet-level attributes, I performed data cleaning, transformation, and modeling within Power BI to prepare the data for analysis.

Project Overview:
-The dashboard is built using a dataset that includes various features like:
-Item Details: Type, Fat Content, Weight, Visibility
-Outlet Information: Establishment Year, Location Type, Size, and Type
-Sales Metrics: Total Sales and Customer Ratings

Key Insights Provided:
Top Performing Items: Visual breakdown of best-selling items by category.
Outlet-Wise Performance: Comparison of sales across different outlet sizes, types, and locations.
Sales Trends: Analysis of how outlet establishment year and item visibility influence sales.
Customer Feedback: Ratings-based insights to identify customer favorites.

Purpose:
This dashboard helps stakeholders at BlinkIT make data-driven decisions regarding:
Inventory planning and stocking based on item popularity.
Outlet performance evaluations and expansion strategies.
Marketing strategies tailored to specific regions or outlet types.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in Power BI, DAX, and data storytellingâ€”turning complex datasets into visually engaging dashboards that support decision-making for retail businesses.
